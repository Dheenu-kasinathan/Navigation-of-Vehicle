# Navigation-of-Vehicle

Goal: To navigate the robot from a start point to the end point only using audio signal of different frequencies. 

Implementaiton: 
  * Designed a prototype of a mobile robot which navigate through a minefield (audio beacons of different fixed frequencies)
  * Performed FFT to plan the path (Shortest, Collision free) of the robot by detecting the frequency of different beacons
